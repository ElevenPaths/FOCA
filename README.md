# FOCA (Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives)

**FOCA  is a tool used mainly to find metadata and hidden information in the documents it scans**. These documents may be on web pages, and can be downloaded and analysed with FOCA.

It is capable of analysing a wide variety of documents, with the most common being **Microsoft Office**, **Open Office**, or **PDF** files, although it also analyses Adobe InDesign or SVG files, for instance.

These documents are searched for using three possible search engines: **Google**, **Bing**, and **DuckDuckGo**. The sum of the results from the three engines amounts to a lot of documents. It is also possible to add local files to extract the EXIF information from graphic files, and a complete analysis of the information discovered through the URL is conducted even before downloading the file.
